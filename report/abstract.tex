Netdog is a simple to use configuration management and monitoring system. It was
developed with schools, colleges and small businesses in mind. Netdog allows
people to easily manage the computers on a network. This includes execution of
commands across all computers, shutting down the computers and even view various
hardware stats across the machines. The current version is the result of over
a thousand commits of code and as a result is a ready to deploy, mature product.
