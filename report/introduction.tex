\chapter{Introduction}

The Netdog project initially started as a simple tool to shutdown computers in a
network. In the course of development, several features were added into it and
it morphed into a easy to use configuration management system.
\\\\
Configuration Management systems are a class of automation software which allows
easy management of computers on a network. Imagine a network where a specific
version of a software needs to be installed across all computers. They can be
achieved through configuration management system.
\\\\
One thing about configuration management systems is that, they are designed for
computer professionals who are not afraid to get their hands dirty and spend
considerable amount of time learning and debugging. This makes these tools not
very accessible to non tech-savvy people. For example, Redhat's Ansible, a
popular configuration management systems expects its users to write the
configuration in YAML format. Not something every literate person in the world
knows.
\\\\
Netdog aims to differ here by offering dead simple interface which can be used
to administer the computers on a network. Amazingly, if a user knows to use the
keyboard and mouse and is aware of the command that is needed to be run across
the machines, he is ready to use Netdog. No further training is needed. But
equally as important, Netdog provides a number of additional features which
makes management of computers on the network a breeze. The following sections
take a more intimate look at Netdog and what it offers.
