# MCA Project Report
KTU compliant project report for MCA

## Introduction

The repo contains the project report that has been done for the main project
of Master of Computer Applications course under A P J Abdual Kalam Technological
University (KTU). The report is based on the project report guidelines released
by KTU for Master of Technology course.

## Getting started

The report is written in in LaTeX. If you are running Linux, the full texlive
package might be required for compiling the report. Once texlive is installed,
you can compile the report using the "xelatex" utility.

    xelatex master.pdf

If you are running Windows, well, you can reinstall your computer with a good
Linux distribution :D

Jokes apart, the easiest way to get this running would be to zip the "report"
directory and upload it to Overleaf.
